This article covers a research initiative to create a “zoo” for a vast variety of different networks. The article covers how through classifying different networks into types researchers can easily study how people interact with networks, and how networks interact with other networks. Though there are issues such as inherent bias in collecting data, the people who gathered the information attempted to remove bias, making the statistics shown more credible.
