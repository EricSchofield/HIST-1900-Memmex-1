This essay by Kevin Driscoll explores one more important aspect of the formation of the modern internet, that of the modem world. Modems were a dial up service that allowed for quite often insulated communities to form on the internet usually around a bulletin board during the early 1990s. These BBSs were incredibly common, with each telephone area code having at least one modem dial up group. Though these were one of the first online gathering places for people, they were eventually ended or rebranded due to privatisation and the desire for BBS providers to make more money.
