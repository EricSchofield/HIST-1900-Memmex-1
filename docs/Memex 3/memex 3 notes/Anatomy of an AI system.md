 _Anotomy of an AI System_ by Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler explores how vast AI systems developed are, such as the amazon echo. Though to a user, they need to only ask a command such as “turn off the lights,” the process that the AI uses to actually understand what is being asked of it takes complicated algorithms, and a connection to a vast amazon central terminal. Even thought he central algorithm already is vast, the process of constructing the device itself and all the infrastructure that comes with it is also incredibly labour intensive and vast. This articles main point is to demonstrate how complex AI systems truly are.

- [[How exploitative is the mining operations to create AI devices]]
- [[Map of the Anatomy of an AI system]]
