This article by Peter Denning explores the creation and history of the Arpanet, and its impact on the world 20 years after it began operations in 1969. He explores the reasons for its creation, how it was used, the technology it created and finally its impact on the world. Denning concludes with the idea that the lasting impact of the ARPANET will not be necessarily the technology itself, but how it changes society and human behaviour.
