## The Journey Between Lecture Notes/January 11 lecture notes and Lecture Notes/April 3 2023 lecture notes - Google
- [[January 11 lecture notes]]
	- This is the first lecture note I took this semester, and as such is the starting point of the journey towards the last lecture not I took this semester
- #internet_history
	- Through the tag of internet history, my first lecture note connects to one of my atomic notes, showing a connection made between my lecture notes and my memex
- [[complete memex/Memex 1 Atomic notes/Does the creation of the modern internet follow the same trajectory as the creation of telegraph lines]]
- #government
	- through another tag, that of a government being involved, the atomic note connects to my final note
- [[Lecture Notes/April 3 2023 lecture notes - Google]]
	- The final lecture note I wrote this semester, which through tags is connected to the first lecture note I wrote this semester 

At the start of the course, I wanted to learn about the evolution of the internet over time. I would say that this was met, and I got what I wanted out of the class. I already expected the internet to have a long history that started before computers, but I did not expect it to be so deep. It was interesting learning that due to its nature the internet does not have a clear start date. Does it start with the first written tablets? Or does it start with the actual launching of the internet, even though that also has multiple possible dates. I was not expecting to learn about the “first internets” such as the printing press and telegrams, but learning about their history gives a lot more context and information on the formation of the modern internet. This can be shown by the journey through my notes up above. It started with the first lecture note I took in this class, and through an atomic note where I asked myself how similar the telegraph network and the modern internet are, connected to my final lecture note. On top of this, I learned about things I had no idea about, such as the importance of women and other minorities in the creation of the modern internet. As shown with the journey, everything in this course ended up being connected to the point where I can easily find a connection between one of my lecture notes about the internet in the late 1990s and an annotated note on the exploitation of gutta-percha making this course more engaging. In conclusion, I am satisfied with this course and got what I was looking for.
