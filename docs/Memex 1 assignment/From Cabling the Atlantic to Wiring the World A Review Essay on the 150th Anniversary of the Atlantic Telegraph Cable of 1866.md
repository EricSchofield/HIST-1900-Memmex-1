Mueller, S. M. (2016). From Cabling the Atlantic to Wiring the World: A Review Essay on the
	150th Anniversary of the Atlantic Telegraph Cable of 1866. _Technology and Culture_, _57_(3), 507–526. 	[https://doi.org/10.1353/tech.2016.006](https://doi.org/10.1353/tech.2016.006)

This article my Simone M. Muller explores and critiques some of the modern reasons that attempt to explain the expansion of telegraphs, from the theories of imperial competition, to that of a expansion of global capitalism. He concludes though that though many theories have been written, none have been entirely correct and that through methods of analysis and scholarly work historians might be able to finally devise a correct theory.
