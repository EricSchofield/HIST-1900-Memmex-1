_Telecommunications and Colonial Rivalry: European Telegraphy Cables to the Canary Islands and Northwest Africa, 1883-1914_ by Javier Quevado explores the great power politics around telegraph cables and the [Canary Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands). It covers the competition between Germany and a combined [France and England](https://www.britannica.com/topic/20th-century-international-relations-2085155/Completing-the-alliance-systems-1890-1907) for control of the telegraph line, and the extent of political maneuvering pursued by both sides. It shows how telegrams were frequently not business ventures, but instead a method of political rivalry the European great powers competed over.
