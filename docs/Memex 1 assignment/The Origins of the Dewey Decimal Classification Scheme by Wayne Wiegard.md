The article _The “Amherst Method”: The Origins of the Dewey Decimal Classification Scheme_ by Wayne Wiegand discusses the influence of [Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvil_Dewey) on the creation of a information classification system, the [Dewey Decimal Classification scheme](https://www.britannica.com/science/Dewey-Decimal-Classification), and where he got his influences from. Wayne argues that Dewey did not come up with the idea, but instead was the one who took the different classification ideas and merged them together into a system that the average library could use.
