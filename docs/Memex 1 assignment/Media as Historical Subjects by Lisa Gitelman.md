Gitelman, Lisa. 2006. “Introduction: Media as Historical Subjects,” [_Always Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture_](http://web.mit.edu/uricchio/Public/television/Gitelman.pdf) (MIT Press)

The book _Introduction: Media as Historical Subjects_ by Lisa Gitelman discusses how media has been interpreted throughout history. This ranges from modern day computers and news corporations to the gramophones of the late 1800s. Gitelman Draws connections between the perception and implementation of such technologies, an example being the spread of [gramophones]( [https://www.britannica.com/technology/gramophone-phonograph](https://www.britannica.com/technology/gramophone-phonograph)) in the early 1900s to many different nations under a British company, which is comparable to the modern international nature of media. She also argues that media is constantly evolving and that it is always defined by the socio-economic context of the times.
