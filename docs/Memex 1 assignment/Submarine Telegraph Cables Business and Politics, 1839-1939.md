_Submarine Telegraph Cables: Business and Politics, 1838-1939_ by Daniel Headrick and Pascal Griset explores the implementation and eventual replacement of telegraph cables throughout the 19th and 20th century. It explores the dominance of Great Britain in the control of telegraph lines, the efforts made by rival powers to rival the British, the political importance of the lines (examples include military use and colonialism) and how companies who actually ran the telegraph lines were rarely independent. The article concludes by exploring how telegraph lines were replaced by radios.

Thoughts:
- [[Does the creation of the modern internet follow the same trajectory as the creation of telegraph lines]]
- [[Is the monopolisation and lack of political independence in telegraphy shared by modern mass media]]
