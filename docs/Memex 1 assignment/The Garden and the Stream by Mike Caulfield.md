Caulfield, Mike. 2015. 'The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral'Â [https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)

The article _The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral_ by Mike Caulfield explores his usage of (federated wiki)[http://fed.wiki.org/view/federated-wiki] to gain a more in depth understanding through the connecting of knowledge between sources he has found, and the sources of others. He argues that this is superior to other forms of social media who rely on only one source and do not attempt to build a network of knowledge in between them. Caulfield uses the metaphors of a Garden and a Stream. He relates the connection of knowledge in federated wiki to a garden, where it does not really matter what part of the garden came first, all that matters is that every plant comes together to form said garden, like how every source comes together to form a digital garden on that site. The analogy of a stream is used for other social media sites where people are caught up in a stream, and only flow down it making it so that outside connections are almost impossible to make.
