The article _A Victorian Ecological Disaster: Imperialism, the Telegraph, and Gutta-Percha_ by John Tully covers the mass exploitation of the [Gutta-Percha tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutta-percha) for its rubbery substance during the 19th and early 20th century. Due to the importance and wide scale usage of Gutta-Percha, the tree was rendered almost extinct causing great amounts of environmental damage in east Asia, where it was mainly found. Though the article discusses how eventually conservation efforts were made to save the plant, it was already too late leading to its extinction in places such as Singapore and great parts of Indonesia.

Thoughts:<br>
- [[Is modern day resource exploitation for the creation of computers similar to the environmental collapse of Gutta-Percha]]<br>
- [[What are the modern uses of Gutta-Percha]]<br>
