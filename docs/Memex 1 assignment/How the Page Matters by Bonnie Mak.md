Mak, [“Architectures of the Page”](https://raley.english.ucsb.edu/wp-content2/uploads/234/Mak.pdf) , chapter 1 of _How the Page Matters._

The first chapter of _How the Page Matters_ by Bonnie Mak discusses why the page matters, and what even is the page. It covers some of the history of the page, mainly from a European history perspective. It discusses how throughout history pages have evolved, from Roman papyrus scrolls to the usage of covers to convey more meaning, to even now with digital technology. Mak discusses how the page has never taken a universal shape and how economics, technology and society have impacted what pages are used.

Thoughts: 
- [[Eurocentrism in the chapter]]
- [[How technology has impacted the spread of knowledge]]
