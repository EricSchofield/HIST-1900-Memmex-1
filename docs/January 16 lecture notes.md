**Mediums and Messages**
- Think about how the impact of a message is changed based on the different forms of messages used
- context of a message can change frequently 
"The medium is the message"
- and media come in different classes or kinds of things
- who decides that something is important?
- whoever makes that decision gains importance/power themselves!
*Classifications both reflect and direct our thinking. The way we order represents the way we think*
- Stephen Jay Gould
The human ability to write stuff down allows us to record things, and transfer knowledge thousands of years into the future
- Writing sytems usually emerged out of a need to count something
- the corelation between sound and writing did not always exist 
- original texts usually held in archives on things like stone tablets
- over time, around the time of the Romans, this changed  with the advent of things like pappyrus scrolls
- now things were divided quite often between more bureaucratic archives, and libraries which were used more for leisure 
- they were quite often organized via genre or author
- lecture reflect the world back onto itself 
- eventually ceramic characters were made able to be put onto paper, the printing press 
- this allowed books to be mass produced
- the standardisation of language and the availability of literature caused a massive increase in literacy 
- allows "anyone" to become someone important
Melville Dewey (1851-1931):
- he wanted to easily disseminate information to the common people 
- he recognizes that the organization for his library sucks 
- he comes up with a method to be able to classification for any possible new information
- uses decimal numbers for this 
- categories like philosophy, theology, government, history, nature...
- pretty much every public library uses it nowadays
- Deweys system hits the United States at the same time that Robber Barons wanted to gain a positive image
- they built things like libraries 
- at the same time though the library of congress also emerged, a competitor to Deweys system 
- the core of the library is for people to be able to actually find stuff 
- the library of congress ends up in universities, and deweys system ends up more in the public field
- the emergence of the digital computer in the 30s and 40s emerges in the context of these biased scholars 

The Memex introduces a completely new idea:
- "*associative indexing... whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another... [so that] numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail*"
- this was believed to destroy classificaiton systems, where sources and literature would point to their influences, and those influences point to this 
- this of course failed, with generally only one side referencing the other 

**Plot so far *continued*
- no natural way for documents/information to be stored
- whoever creates the storage dictates the terms
- In a north american context, the two big approaches hit at the same time there is massive public investment and expansion and reform of education (even the blackboard was a new idea once!)
- proximity 
- invention of the digital computer happens not all that long after these massive
