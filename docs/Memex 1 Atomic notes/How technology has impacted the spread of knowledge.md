Mak discusses the history of pages, but she does not go into much depth about more modern developments about the page, such as the development of the [printing press](https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?query=any,contains,printing%20press&tab=OCULDiscoveryNetworkNew&search_scope=NewDiscoveryNetwork&vid=01OCUL_CRL:CRL_DEFAULT&facet=tlevel,include,peer_reviewed&offset=0) and the [internet](https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?query=any,contains,the%20internet%20and%20the%20spread%20of%20information&tab=OCULDiscoveryNetworkNew&search_scope=NewDiscoveryNetwork&vid=01OCUL_CRL:CRL_DEFAULT&facet=tlevel,include,peer_reviewed&offset=0). How has those impacted the spread and standardisation of pages? Carleton library can be used to find information on both.
