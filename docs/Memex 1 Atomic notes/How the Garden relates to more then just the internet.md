The garden as described by this article is the connection of many things together to form something greater. This can apply to gathering knowledge, but I also think it can apply to many more things, such as an example be building a building. A building is not just one thing, it is the coming together of many different materials to create one thing, the garden. A video of a building being constructed, as you can see many different parts coming together: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6f_sayw0mM]].
