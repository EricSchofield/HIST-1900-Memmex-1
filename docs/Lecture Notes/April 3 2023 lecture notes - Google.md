- google was different as it used a structured method for looking for information <br>
- other sites used keywords, which was easily exploitable <br>
- the idea that important sites will have other important sites pointing towards them <br>
- grad project starts in 1996, and by 1999 it has indexed 6 million sites<br>
- in 2000 google starts selling advertisements <br>
- leads to immediate legal action because another advertisement had created it first <br>
- by 2001 Larry Paige has screwed up enough so that Eric Schmitt is brought in as "parrental supervision"<br>
- google was the best browser overall, so it became more and more popular<br>
- dot com bubble had mostly calmed down <br>
- googles ip starts in 2004 <br>
- in 2005 google is listed as 52 billion dollars <br>
- yahoo by this point splits off their alliance with google and starts circling the drain <br>
- by the 2010s, google buys up other services, and if something is seen as a risk, they try and kill it off <br>
- monopoly behaviour <br>
- google is caught up in many different scandals, such as sexual harassment, predatory surveillance... and it triggers the sherman anti trust laws <br>
- google is the lens that we use to search the internet <br>
- google emerges in the post cold war pre 9/11 era, where it embodies the neo-liberal web <br>
- and once 9/11 happens, google easily transforms into working with the government for surveillance<br>
- attention scarcity is a very powerful force on the internet, so the spaces that can maximize the usage of that attention scarcity <br>
- the early language google used was very democratic, and making the implicit connection that "google was democracy"<br>
- this though was not true, and was more of a circle where well used sites just got more and more popular <br>
- this got burried very quickly <br>
**Brin & Page themselves, 1998:**<br>
	'The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users. For example, in our prototype search engine one of the top results for cel- lular phone is ... a study which explains [the] risk associated with conversing on a cell phone while driving ... It is clear that a search engine which was taking money for showing cellular phone ads would have difficulty justifying the page ... For this type of reason and historical experience with other search engines we ... expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. ... Since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, search engine bias is particularly insidious ... [and] less blatant bias are likely to be tolerated by the market. (Brin and Page 1998: 17â€“18)'<br>
- People quickly learn how to game these things - search engine optimization<br>
- search algorithms are not neutral, and quite often bigotry and oppression are built into the internet <br>
- many internet companies firing their chief ethics reasearchers <br>
- they are fired due to them demonstrating things such as climate change and copyright infringement <br>
- Our history of the internet largely ends here, more or less ten years ago.<br>
- There were lots of moments that I didn't go into<br>
- Now you know the kinds of things to look for<br>
- one concept remains<br>
**Enshittification:**<br>
*Here is how platforms die: First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business custormers; finally, they abuse those business custormers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.*
- examples of this are things such as how amazon has forced consumers and businesses to work for them, or how facebook does not allow links to things such as articles<br>
**The Enshittification of Facebook:**<br>
- "They trust me. Dumb fucks" - Zuckerberg <br>
- originally created a site to creep on female harvard students <br>
- used early log in data to try and break into the harvard newspaper <br>
- eventually investigated by harvard itself <br>
- due to monopoliztion, google and facebook came to a agreement <br>
