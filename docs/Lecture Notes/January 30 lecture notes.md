History can be seen as a ladder, that builds upon itself 

- linin 
- It could be painted
- it was used as a form of record keeping, and art 
- purple dye was especially expensive due to its difficulty to obtain 

Silk was incredibly expensive, and mainly produced in china via boiling silkworms, whose caccoons would produce threads
The silk road was created by this want for silk, from China to rome
- Justinian the Great was the first to actually try and figure out where the hell the silk came from and sent some guys to get some
- they actually got some and set up a industry in constantinople

Implications of a drawloom
- 2 person set up
- slow - care, feeding, value?

**Silk Industry of Lyon**<br>
- Louis the eleventh establishes a silk industry in Lyon, along with all the materials that are associated it <br>
- stole some Italian weevers, invaded Italy because <br>
- by the 18th century, it still took 2 people to weeve it <br>
- 30000 people employed in the weeving business at its height <br>
- they though needed it to be faster<br>
- Jacke de vaucanson 1709-1782<br>
	- created a pooping duck <br>
	- he created a machine that could recreate patterns <br>
- Joseph-Marie Jacquard, 1752-1834<br>
	- Lyon was a monarchist stronghold, and he was a counter-revolutionary <br>
	- Lyon gets sieged, and he decided to become a revolutionary <br>
	- revolution is pretty successful, but a major consequence was that it had a "cult of rationality "<br>
	- what is more rational then a machine?<br>
	- Napolean put a ton of effort into fostering innovation<br>
	- money was dumped into the silk industry in a attempt to expand the industry, and in turn expand the french economy <br>
	- Jacquard managed to get money from this and manages to create a machine to automate silk production<br>
	- this massively increases the speed of production, and only relies on one person<br>
- though this is very similar to punchcards, Jacquard was not the one who invented them <br>
- Louis Faucon/Falcon in 1728, but in his arrangement, the draw boy had to hold the card in place manually; faucon <br>
- What did Jacquard invent?<br>
	- an approach that applied threaded together punch cards to the automatic control of the loom<br>
		- 24 x speed increase! (ie 2 feet per day)<br>
		- replicable patterns, complex patterns, multiple machines, producint indentical swathes of silk<br>
- what really matters about Jacquard's invention are the cards, not the loom<br>
- Charles Babbage<br>
	- difference Engine/Analytical Engine<br>
	- 'difference' because it uses the method of differences to calculate tables by adding the differences between items in a series. But had to be set up manually: no cards<br>
	- "We may say most aptly that the analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves..."<br> - Ada Lovelace<br>
		- depends upon cards to enter data, output data, store instructions<br>
	- we'll talk more about babbage - and more importantly, Ada Lovelace - later<br>
	- machine is never actually built<br>
	- but people see the concept of punch cards<br>
- Coupling punch cards with electro-mechanical counting sets in train the development of the *digital computer* which we'll turn to, eventually <br>
