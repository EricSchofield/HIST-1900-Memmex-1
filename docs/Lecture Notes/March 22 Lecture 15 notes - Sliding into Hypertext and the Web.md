**Some Dates:**
- 1983: ARPANET switches over to TC/ICP; MILNET split off
- 1983 Domain Names system devixed
- 1984 comes into effect: .gov, .mil, .edu, .org, .net and .com
- 1986 NSF backbone is built, NSF, like DCA before it, limits use to 'approved' uses. Also decides to use TC/ICP
- 1987 over 10000 hosts now on 'the internet'
- 1988 commercial email allowed to be transported over NSFNet - commercialization of that infrasturcture begins 
- Senator Al Gore becomes interested in networks for research
- 1990 ARPANet shuts down 
- 1991 Gore proposes, and sees it through, The High Performance Computing Act. This is the 'information superhighway' financing bill, which amongst other things funds the team that builds the first Webrowser (Mosaic, 1993; evolves into Netscape)
- 1991 web comes into existence; 1993 explodes into popular imagination
**Brief tour of early viruses**
- Von Newman wrote a book on how a possible internet "animal"
- First 'viruses' and 'worms' written mostly as experiments 
- Creeper - designed by Bob Thomas at BBN: it would copy itself onto connected computers. The first worm. 1971. 'I'M THE CREEPER CATCH ME IF YOU CAN'
- Reaper - designed by Ray Tomlison, to seek out and eliminate Creeper, 1972
- Animal - the first Trojan, 1975 by John Walker
	- ANIMAL was a 20-questions style game, 'what animal am I thinking of'
	- secret program included in it called PERVADE; when game ran, PERVADE would examine the system for directories available to the user, and then copy ANIMAL to those directories
	**Westworld:**
	- Movie by Micheal Crichton in 1973, features a virus as a pivotal point 
- Once the genie is out of the bottle, lots of virus/worms/trojans emerge 
- often the motivation is curiosity - who wouldn't want to create artificial life, amirite?
- but not always
- BRAIN BOOT SECTOR VIRUS - first IBM PC virus - 1986
	- would essentially crash the machine during boot up
- **The Morris Worm - 1988**
	- within 24 hours approximately 1/10th of connected machines(~6000) infected 
	- used many different vectors to break into computers 
	- it did not destroy anything, but was massively disruptive 
	- the man who accidentally released it realized his mistake and attempted to fix it 
**The Story so far:**
- the 1980s sees a growing awareness of 'connected' computing 
- turning up in culture (eg. WarGames; Terminator)
- Commercialization of the government created infrastructure
- Interworking of private networks into that infrastructure 
- common carriage of traffic (what is later called net neutrality) a feature
- Al Gore secures funding for another round of development, meant to expand access and foster more research
- 1980s Text Interfaces kinda sucked though 
**Hypertext:**
- A long history of devices being built to collect certain information quickly and efficiently 
- Information management 
- **Jorge Luis Borges, Garden Of Forking Paths (spanish], 1941; English, 1948**
	- "This web of time - the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the centuries - embraces every possibility"
- **In computerized hypertext:**
	- some act of selection enables you to pass to another level or another related concept
	- a formalization and action based on a *relationship*
	- the relationship itself has some capacity to act 
- **Tet Nelson, Xanadu:**
	- coins the word 'hypertext'
	- never buit
	- modern day hypertext is just thought to be pointing in a direction towards another site, though this is quite basic 
- A *pattern language* per Maggie Appleton hepls us approach questions like:
	- How do we structure information and build relationships between pieces of data that help us see them across contexts, and clarify 
	- How do we build systems that allow people to collaborate on shared documents without losing authorship? How do we credit and compensate authors based on their contributions?
	- How do we bring ideas and data from a variety of sources into coversation with our own, while leaving a clear trail back to the origin
	- Nelson: "HTML is precisely what we were trying to PREVENT - ever - breaking links, links going outward only, quotes you can't follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management."
	- "What we're now seeing is the ad-hoc, decentralised manifestation of Xanadu in bits and pieces.
	- People are building Xanadu without knowing what Xanadu is.
	- Which is the essence of a good pattern language; true patterns evolve naturally within systems, and are found rather than crafted." - Maggie Appleton
**Microcosm:**
- 1986 BBC produces a new Doomesday Book - on laser disc
- interactive explorations, with links and a pointer; demo from 1991
- Inspiration for Wendy Hall, U Southampton
- intermedia - a connected five different applications into a 'scholar's worksation' Nicole Yankelovich, Nancy Garrett, Karen Caitlin; Apple nicks elements of the design
- Sun Microsystems - Link Service, developed by Amy Pearl
- Symbolics - Symbolics Document Examiner by Janet Walker
- Xerox - Cathy Marshall, works on NoteCards, subsequently develops Aquanet and Viki - 1984
- A very similar product becomes bundled with Apple in 1987, 'HyperCard', 1987
- "HyperText is a way to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will. It provides a single user-interface to large classes of information (reports, notes, data-bases, computer documentation and on-line help). We propose a simple scheme incorporating servers already available at CERN... A program which provides access to the hypertext world we call a browser... " Tim Berners-Lee, R. Cailliau. 12 November 1990, CERN
- All links are one way, all links are unaware and that was basically it 
- The key difference was that the documents could live on other computers
- the people at hypertext '91 was mostly ignored his proposal 
- though over time, this system becomes much more accepted and eventually becomes the norm 
- one of the resons that this simple system was so successful was because it was simple and easy to impliment 
- **Clare Evans:**
	- "today, we mostly think of hypertext as being something related to the Web, rather than of the Web as a technically inferior manifestation of hypertext principles"
