Took around 30, 40 years to get from experimental phonograms to telephones 
- lovers telegraph, two tin cans and a tight string 
- telephones had existed back then, but they had negative connetations 
- not the case for harmonic telephones 
For any invention to become successful, it requires competence, technology and a social want 

**Dates for the 'invention' of the telephone:**
- 1840 - Charles Page
- 1854 - Charles Bourseul
- 1854 - Antonio Meucci
- 1857 - Johann Philipp Reis
- 1864 - Inoocenzo Manzetti
- 1876 - Bell vs Gray
- 1878 - Cyrille Duquet
- 1878 - Thomas Edison and Emile Berliner

- One of the competences was the 18th century earhorn, that picked up sound or transmitted it quite well, and they where called telephone 
- Things such as the 'Enchanted Lyre' where he connected a thread to a piano, drilled a holl through the floor and connected it to a lyre, which transmitted the sound 

**Follow the Money**
- the results of this kind of work implied serious financial benefits to existing telegraphy 
- different signals, sounding different notes, could be sent down a single wire 
- ie, more messages on the same physical infrastructure 
- such devices, if they could be built, were called harmonic telephones

**Missing piece**
- M Clarac - french telegraph official - found tubes with powered carbon could be put under pressure; the amount of electrical resistence could be regulated through that pressure 
- Lord Kelvin - had earlier shown that resistence to electricity in a wire could be modified by putting the wire under tension

"Fearing ridicule would be attached to the idea of transmitting vocal sounds telephonically... I said nothing of this plan" - Bell
- Bell's early patents positioned his work as a telegraphic device
- Elisha Gray's early caveats/patents position his work more as a telephone
- frankly, who-invented-what-when is a mess of competing patents, caveats, and court cases
- And then there's the problem (for Bell and Gray) of Philip Reiss

**The breaks and accelerators**
- what is the business model for telephones?
- legal troubles

**What do you do with a telephone, anyway?**
- church services 
- concerts 
- all day news broadcasts
