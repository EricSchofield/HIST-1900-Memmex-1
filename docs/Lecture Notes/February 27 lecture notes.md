Took around 30, 40 years to get from experimental phonograms to telephones <br>
- lovers telegraph, two tin cans and a tight string <br>
- telephones had existed back then, but they had negative connetations <br>
- not the case for harmonic telephones <br>
For any invention to become successful, it requires competence, technology and a social want <br>

**Dates for the 'invention' of the telephone:**<br>
- 1840 - Charles Page<br>
- 1854 - Charles Bourseul<br>
- 1854 - Antonio Meucci<br>
- 1857 - Johann Philipp Reis<br>
- 1864 - Inoocenzo Manzetti<br>
- 1876 - Bell vs Gray<br>
- 1878 - Cyrille Duquet<br>
- 1878 - Thomas Edison and Emile Berliner<br>

- One of the competences was the 18th century earhorn, that picked up sound or transmitted it quite well, and they where called telephone 
- Things such as the 'Enchanted Lyre' where he connected a thread to a piano, drilled a holl through the floor and connected it to a lyre, which transmitted the sound 

**Follow the Money**<br>
- the results of this kind of work implied serious financial benefits to existing telegraphy <br>
- different signals, sounding different notes, could be sent down a single wire <br>
- ie, more messages on the same physical infrastructure <br>
- such devices, if they could be built, were called harmonic telephones<br>

**Missing piece**<br>
- M Clarac - french telegraph official - found tubes with powered carbon could be put under pressure; the amount of electrical resistence could be regulated through that pressure<br> 
- Lord Kelvin - had earlier shown that resistence to electricity in a wire could be modified by putting the wire under tension<br>

"Fearing ridicule would be attached to the idea of transmitting vocal sounds telephonically... I said nothing of this plan" - Bell<br>
- Bell's early patents positioned his work as a telegraphic device<br>
- Elisha Gray's early caveats/patents position his work more as a telephone<br>
- frankly, who-invented-what-when is a mess of competing patents, caveats, and court cases<br>
- And then there's the problem (for Bell and Gray) of Philip Reiss<br>

**The breaks and accelerators**<br>
- what is the business model for telephones?<br>
- legal troubles<br>

**What do you do with a telephone, anyway?**<br>
- church services <br>
- concerts <br>
- all day news broadcasts<br>
