Can you keep a Secret?
- when nobody can read, writing can be used to hide things 
- but cryptology is needed once literacy becomes more common 
- *Sometimes*, it's the pattern of communications that is key
- You can connect groups together to decipher intentions 
- cryptology relies on both the actual cryptology, but also on how information is moved around 
- A code: 'variable sized elements that have meaning in the plaintext language' - syllables, words, phrases (Dooley, 5); thousands of substitutions
- A cipher: a transformation from plaintext according to some transformation (Dooley, 5-6); 'small fixed number of substitution elements'
- many different forms of encryption
- After the muslim conquests of much of byzantine land, much of ancient roman and greek texts were translated 
- Al-Kindi, a muslim scholar developed a method to break simple cyphers using frequency analysis
- not much in europe 
- eventually in the 19th century cryptology becomes much more serious about things like cryptology, which eventually develops into information studies 
**Early Modern Europe (16th to about 1800 ish)**
- remember, intro of a new information technology in Europe (moveable types) is also a marker for this period 
- faster circulation of ideas
- new ideas around relationship of people to God, to each other, nature of government, what is a state, anyway... all these things up for discussion 
- coinciding with European age of discovery too...
- Francis Bacon, a english intellectual during the reign of Queen Elizabeth developed a encodement method using only a and b 
- this relied quite a bit on the quircks of printing presses
**Nomenclators**
- mixture of substitution cyphers and codebooks
- stil susceptible to frequency analysis and context-dependat guessing
- popular in diplomatic circles 1400- to about 1800
- Mary Queen of Scotts - nomeclator broken, her attempt to seize power thwarted
Next major developments comes after the French revolution 
- A dude named Chappe develops a system where on the top a tower a mechanized light viewable for about 6 km with a possible for 100 different combination 
- system was so effective that by 1854, the Chappe telegraph stretches into Germany and Venice
- went great, until 1849 when morse managed to send a message from Washington to Baltimore using a electric wire
