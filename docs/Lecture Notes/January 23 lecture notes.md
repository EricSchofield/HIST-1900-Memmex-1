Can you keep a Secret?<br>
- when nobody can read, writing can be used to hide things <br>
- but cryptology is needed once literacy becomes more common <br>
- *Sometimes*, it's the pattern of communications that is key<br>
- You can connect groups together to decipher intentions <br>
- cryptology relies on both the actual cryptology, but also on how information is moved around <br>
- A code: 'variable sized elements that have meaning in the plaintext language' - syllables, words, phrases (Dooley, 5); thousands of substitutions<br>
- A cipher: a transformation from plaintext according to some transformation (Dooley, 5-6); 'small fixed number of substitution elements'<br>
- many different forms of encryption<br>
- After the muslim conquests of much of byzantine land, much of ancient roman and greek texts were translated <br>
- Al-Kindi, a muslim scholar developed a method to break simple cyphers using frequency analysis<br>
- not much in europe <br>
- eventually in the 19th century cryptology becomes much more serious about things like cryptology, which eventually develops into information studies <br>
**Early Modern Europe (16th to about 1800 ish)**<br>

- coinciding with European age of discovery too...<br>
- Francis Bacon, a english intellectual during the reign of Queen Elizabeth developed a encodement method using only a and b <br>
- this relied quite a bit on the quircks of printing presses<br>
**Nomenclators**<br>
- mixture of substitution cyphers and codebooks<br>
- stil susceptible to frequency analysis and context-dependat guessing<br>
- popular in diplomatic circles 1400- to about 1800<br>
- Mary Queen of Scotts - nomeclator broken, her attempt to seize power thwarted<br>
Next major developments comes after the French revolution <br>
- A dude named Chappe develops a system where on the top a tower a mechanized light viewable for about 6 km with a possible for 100 different combination <br>
- system was so effective that by 1854, the Chappe telegraph stretches into Germany and Venice<br>
- went great, until 1849 when morse managed to send a message from Washington to Baltimore using a electric wire<br>
