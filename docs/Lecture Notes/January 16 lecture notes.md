**Mediums and Messages**<br>
- Think about how the impact of a message is changed based on the different forms of messages used<br>
- context of a message can change frequently <br>
"The medium is the message"<br>
- and media come in different classes or kinds of things<br>
- who decides that something is important?<br>
- whoever makes that decision gains importance/power themselves!<br>
*Classifications both reflect and direct our thinking. The way we order represents the way we think*<br>
- Stephen Jay Gould<br>
The human ability to write stuff down allows us to record things, and transfer knowledge thousands of years into the future<br>
- Writing sytems usually emerged out of a need to count something<br>
- the corelation between sound and writing did not always exist <br>
- original texts usually held in archives on things like stone tablets<br>
- over time, around the time of the Romans, this changed  with the advent of things like pappyrus scrolls<br>
- now things were divided quite often between more bureaucratic archives, and libraries which were used more for leisure <br>
- they were quite often organized via genre or author<br>
- lecture reflect the world back onto itself <br>
- eventually ceramic characters were made able to be put onto paper, the printing press <br>
- this allowed books to be mass produced<br>
- the standardisation of language and the availability of literature caused a massive increase in literacy <br>
- allows "anyone" to become someone important<br>
Melville Dewey (1851-1931):<br>
- he wanted to easily disseminate information to the common people <br>
- he recognizes that the organization for his library sucks <br>
- he comes up with a method to be able to classification for any possible new information <br>
- uses decimal numbers for this <br>
- categories like philosophy, theology, government, history, nature...<br>
- pretty much every public library uses it nowadays<br>
- Deweys system hits the United States at the same time that Robber Barons wanted to gain a positive image<br>
- they built things like libraries <br>
- at the same time though the library of congress also emerged, a competitor to Deweys system <br>
- the core of the library is for people to be able to actually find stuff <br>
- the library of congress ends up in universities, and deweys system ends up more in the public field<br>
- the emergence of the digital computer in the 30s and 40s emerges in the context of these biased scholars <br>

The Memex introduces a completely new idea:<br>
- "*associative indexing... whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another... [so that] numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail*"<br>
- this was believed to destroy classificaiton systems, where sources and literature would point to their influences, and those influences point to this <br>
- this of course failed, with generally only one side referencing the other <br>

**Plot so far *continued*<br>
- no natural way for documents/information to be stored<br>
- whoever creates the storage dictates the terms<br>
- In a north american context, the two big approaches hit at the same time there is massive public investment and expansion and reform of education (even the blackboard was a new idea once!)<br>
- proximity <br>
- invention of the digital computer happens not all that long after these massive <br>
