- By the end of the 1990s, 450 listed companies were related to the internet 
- this ended up with the .com crash 
- this is very similar to the south seas bublle in the 1720s
	- coffee was first making its way to europe 
	- coffee houses started to be formed 
	- people of different classes interacted, newspapers were formed 
	- **South Seas Bubble:**
		- British government needed refinancing of its debt after various wars 
		- South Seas Company has a promised monopoly on trading slaves to South America 
		- What it actually has is an arrangement to buy government debt 
		- run by members of the nobility and government 
		- government sells all debt to the south seas company, so now the government does not actually owe people money, and the government would pay a dividence each day 
		- the shares exploded due to the money coming in 
		- people from coffee houses etc. are convinced that they need to buy shares, hype for the company is massive 
		- people thought that they could only make money, even though the company was incredibly sketchy 
- **Irrational Exuberance:**
	- this time, its different!!!
	- Creative destruction 
	- the idea that you can "Get Rich Quick"
- **The Rise of Bezos:**
	- from a wealthy family, got a degree in electrical engineering and com sci from princeton 
	- initially worked for a hedge fund, and was tasked with making a profitable internet endeavour 
	- this did not work out, so he took his severance and moved to washington 
	- he decided to create a internet business around books
	- **Why Books?**
		- Large industry (25 billion in annual sales)
		- large number of publishers (> 50000 in US)
		- independant book shops at retail; 2 chains < 25% of retail market 
		- chaings had stores, assets, employees, warehouses => costs
		- gets loan of $250000 from his parents 
		- launches amazon in 1995 
		- has ~1 million in seed funds from local investors as well
		- did not have lower prices
		- buy your book online, they get it from the local warehouse, repackage it, and then mail it to you (taking advantage of existing government paid for infrastructure)
		- this was not profitable, and bezos concludes that he needs more money for it to work
		- enter the venture capitalists, who want to make money 
		- due to connections, he managed to run a story in the wall street journal, which results in a final offer of 60 million dollars from investors in 1996
		- still amazon is not profitable, pays 25$ for a book, but only gets 20$ per book 
		- he subscribes to the "winner takes all" philosophy 
		- idea that if you get big enough, customers will be forced to deal with you 
		- bezos concludes that he needs to buy or kill all of his competition
		- goes public, creates a artificial scarcity to make even more money 
- this is the strategy of the .com boom 
- the era of the "paper millionaire"
- most staff are payed with stock options, but with a ton of caviats such as they cannot use said stock options until 1 or 2 years 
- a bill will eventually come 
- this comes in march of 2000 
- the .com boom created a ton of capacity, but did not create any sustainability 
- nastech starts to crash 
- some of the survivors were amazon and ebay 
- two important sites are formed during this period, that would greatly impact the future internet 
	1. first one is the Internet Archive - 1996
		- formed by Bruce, a entrepreneur
		- company named alexa internet 
		- it monitered the internet, and tracked what was happening, and sold that to people like amazon 
	2. Second one is Wikipedia
		- formed due to the idea that it was really hard to actually find accurate information 
		- originally had a team of people with PHDs
		- founder wanted to have a cheaper sight, so he outsourced the work just to the community
		- this is wikipedia 
- **Lasting impact of the dot com boom:**
	- the internetification of logistics 
	- emergence of 'content'
	- development of advertising
