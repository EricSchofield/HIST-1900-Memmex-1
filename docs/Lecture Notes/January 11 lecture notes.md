bunch of paywalled stuff is on sihub

- teks comes from the proto indo-european "Teks-" meaning "to weave" and "to fabrigate"
- Jicard loom punchcards, the predecessor of things such as bits, was invented in the 18th century. They enabled the replication of individual thread patterns 
- The history of the internet frequently relied on women
- core rope memory was used for the apollo space program 
- The cost of the internet is something very physical, it connects us to the chinese market, it degrades the environment and conflicts in the congo have been created through a need to control mining of materials used in computers
- theory is simply a framework for understanding the world, its not something hard 
- many things have collapsed space and time, examples being roman roads, telegraphs, and eventually the internet 
- complex vs complicated: 
	- complex could be something like a trafic jam on the queensway, it has feedback loops, and it can recover from damage
	- complicated systems are like the space shuttle, if something small breaks then it can have a catastrophic effect, like the challenger 
- Assemblage Theory:
	- Things have an active ability and ajency on their own to come together 
	- some old dead french dudes 
- Perspectivism:
	- the way we record information matters
	- think of the perception of race 
- a network is present whenever there is a relationship between two or more entities along which information flows. 
- networks form a substrate for social life, and humans aren't the only things that can have a social life 
- networks leave physical traces 
- complex phenomena are different from complicated phenomena 
- more complex phenomena can emerge from interactions in certain network shapes 
- networks also provide a formal mechanism through which computation can happen - computation is inherent in the shape of the network 
- the components of a networked history are not just the technical objects, but also the assemblage 
- material agencies extend cognition into our things 
- meaning is relational
