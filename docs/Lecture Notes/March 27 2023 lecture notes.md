The internet is developing across the world, but the majority of it came out of America <br>
- the 90s had a sense of progressive optimism, the soviets had fallen everything was looking up in theory <br>
- Clinton was in power, though he had removed some important anti trust laws on media companies <br>
- culture war issues was only slightly starting, it was not a big issue <br>
- neo-liberalism was being heavily implemented<br>
- if you could create your own website, you could own it<br> 
- from about 1990s - early 2000s the internet was a new frontier, lots of money to be made and many different individual players <br>
**The start of browsers:**<br>
- real estate on sites start becoming very important <br>
- netscape goes public in 1995, the initial offer doubled the first day <br>
- a ton of money is dumped into browsers <br>
- given 2 billion dollars <br>
- added plugins so people could expand the site <br>
- windows '95 comes online <br>
- the regular media, unaware of how their business strategy was about to get destroyed, would run tons of stories about tech stuff<br>
- by 1996, netscape has 36 million users <br>
- it was becoming that a browser would be a "everything machine"<br>
- different manufacturors were bundling browsers onto their machines <br>
- microsoft starts developing explore <br>
- microsoft wants to kill netscape, and by using their connections they just keep giving explorer away <br>
- lobby manufatorers to bundle explorer with computres instead of netscape <br>
- they tightly integrate explorer into windows os<br>
- this monopolisation triggered a anti trust investigation <br>
- netscape cannot go head to head with microsoft <br>
- by 1998 netscape is encountering declining growth <br>
- by 2008, netscape dies <br>
- from this though, the mozilla foundation is formed<br>
- they take the remnants of the netscape and start developing firefox <br>
- google is founded on the observation of network analysis <br>
- in 1994 two graduate students keep a list of all sites, it eventually becomes yahoo <br>
- rise of the tech bro <br>
- they gain power and economic power due to their ability to direct attention to different sites <br>
- in 2000, it signs a deal that allows them to use googles search algorithm <br>
- it was a "darling" of the early net, but when the .com crash happened its shares dropped from a 193$ - 4$<br>
- it tried to be a "everything machine", but was pretty much just a fancy bullotin board <br>
- the web is becoming very gendered <br>
- the combination of the utopian idea of the internet, and the perceived dystopia of games combines itself <br>
- history of games is messy <br>
**Getting your own space:**<br>
- people were drawn in with the idea that you could have your own persnal space <br>
- some of the webpages from early carletons website still remain <br>
- if you wanted to actually find something, you went to 1 of 3 sites in the 1990s<br>
	1. Geocities<br>
	- originally developed by a man who had lost his partner <br>
	- he made something called "beverly hills internet" so that people could form free websites<br>
	- was originally made for a need of "community"<br>
	- by 1995, 1400 websites were hosted <br>
	- in 1996, it was growing by about 8000 users a day <br>
	- geocities goes public in 1998<br>
	- goes up to 4.6 billin dollars as a price <br>
	- yahoo buys geocities, and instantly kills the location aspect <br>
	- turns the location into usernames <br>
	- in 2009, they just kill off geocities <br>
	- destroyed a incredible amount of information and history <br>
	- in 1997, it had 1000000 users <br>
	- the key was the neighbourhood system <br>
	- it also used webcams to tie neighbourhoods to actual locations<br>
	- **Excavating GeoCities:**<br>
		- the ruins of GeoCities exist os a *torrent* from internet archive <br>
		- sites can be pulled from it; because of backwards compatibility, a lot of these sites can still work (for a given value of 'work')<br>
		- the work of Ian Milligan <br>
		- people from GeoCities were the ones who formed internet 2.0<br>
	- used a lot of the same language as the homestead act of the 1860s <br>
	- relied on the community to do really everything, such as moderation <br>
	- Community Leaders Emerged <br>
	- quite often female, they would modereate communities <br>
	- would do things such as give custom awards for good behaviour<br>

**Section 230:**<br>
- "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. (47 U.S.C. section 230(c)(1)"<br>
- this is used to shield a lot of bad behaviour, such as facebook hosting terrorist stuff <br>
- they had a insentive not to moderate, because if they tried it they could be prosecuted for the things they missed <br>
- so section 230 applies regardless of how much content moderation gets done, but lots of people treat it as if it does <br>
- this builds the modern internet <br>
