The internet is developing across the world, but the majority of it came out of America 
- the 90s had a sense of progressive optimism, the soviets had fallen everything was looking up in theory 
- Clinton was in power, though he had removed some important anti trust laws on media companies 
- culture war issues was only slightly starting, it was not a big issue 
- neo-liberalism was being heavily implemented
- if you could create your own website, you could own it 
- from about 1990s - early 2000s the internet was a new frontier, lots of money to be made and many different individual players 
**The start of browsers:**
- real estate on sites start becoming very important 
- netscape goes public in 1995, the initial offer doubled the first day 
- a ton of money is dumped into browsers 
- given 2 billion dollars 
- added plugins so people could expand the site 
- windows '95 comes online 
- the regular media, unaware of how their business strategy was about to get destroyed, would run tons of stories about tech stuff
- by 1996, netscape has 36 million users 
- it was becoming that a browser would be a "everything machine"
- different manufacturors were bundling browsers onto their machines 
- microsoft starts developing explore 
- microsoft wants to kill netscape, and by using their connections they just keep giving explorer away 
- lobby manufatorers to bundle explorer with computres instead of netscape 
- they tightly integrate explorer into windows os
- this monopolisation triggered a anti trust investigation 
- netscape cannot go head to head with microsoft 
- by 1998 netscape is encountering declining growth 
- by 2008, netscape dies 
- from this though, the mozilla foundation is formed
- they take the remnants of the netscape and start developing firefox 
- google is founded on the observation of network analysis 
- in 1994 two graduate students keep a list of all sites, it eventually becomes yahoo 
- rise of the tech bro 
- they gain power and economic power due to their ability to direct attention to different sites 
- in 2000, it signs a deal that allows them to use googles search algorithm 
- it was a "darling" of the early net, but when the .com crash happened its shares dropped from a 193$ - 4$
- it tried to be a "everything machine", but was pretty much just a fancy bullotin board 
- the web is becoming very gendered 
- the combination of the utopian idea of the internet, and the perceived dystopia of games combines itself 
- history of games is messy 
**Getting your own space:**
- people were drawn in with the idea that you could have your own persnal space 
- some of the webpages from early carletons website still remain 
- if you wanted to actually find something, you went to 1 of 3 sites in the 1990s
	1. Geocities
	- originally developed by a man who had lost his partner 
	- he made something called "beverly hills internet" so that people could form free websites
	- was originally made for a need of "community"
	- by 1995, 1400 websites were hosted 
	- in 1996, it was growing by about 8000 users a day 
	- geocities goes public in 1998
	- goes up to 4.6 billin dollars as a price 
	- yahoo buys geocities, and instantly kills the location aspect 
	- turns the location into usernames 
	- in 2009, they just kill off geocities 
	- destroyed a incredible amount of information and history 
	- in 1997, it had 1000000 users 
	- the key was the neighbourhood system 
	- it also used webcams to tie neighbourhoods to actual locations
	- **Excavating GeoCities:**
		- the ruins of GeoCities exist os a *torrent* from internet archive 
		- sites can be pulled from it; because of backwards compatibility, a lot of these sites can still work (for a given value of 'work')
		- the work of Ian Milligan 
		- people from GeoCities were the ones who formed internet 2.0
	- used a lot of the same language as the homestead act of the 1860s 
	- relied on the community to do really everything, such as moderation 
	- Community Leaders Emerged 
	- quite often female, they would modereate communities 
	- would do things such as give custom awards for good behaviour

	3. tripod
**Section 230:**
- "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. (47 U.S.C. section 230(c)(1)"
- this is used to shield a lot of bad behaviour, such as facebook hosting terrorist stuff 
- they had a insentive not to moderate, because if they tried it they could be prosecuted for the things they missed 
- so section 230 applies regardless of how much content moderation gets done, but lots of people treat it as if it does 
- this builds the modern internet
