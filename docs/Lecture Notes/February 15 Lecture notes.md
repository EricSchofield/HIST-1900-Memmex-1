Due to social necessity, things are invented
- example of this is electrical telegraph, which was created due to railroads 
- the advent of the telegraph is very similar to the emergence of digital media about a century later
Breaking forces emerge:
- things like patent battles 
- who invented what first
- morse loses a patent battle against the british, France just nationalized everything 
- in the 19th century, the idea of the corporation had to be invented so that they could finance railroads 
- between the 1830s and 1860s a huge wave of laws aiding the setting up of companies emerges so that things such as stocks can be distributed between people
- newspapers as well, who were interested in selling papers 
- the newspapers did not really care about telling actual news stories, and because of things such as the telegram newspapers could plagiarise other newspapers for monetary gain
- lot of money to be made
Multiple services emerge, multiple lawsuits
- Henry O'Reilly in the western US; secures right to explit Morse patents; Morse later regrets this 
- Cooke and Wheatsore have american patents prior to Morse
- Alexander Bain, 'chemical telegraph' (1843)
- Competing services, technologies stringing lines side-by-side (as between Boston and Washington, New York and Buffalo)
- Eventually Morse is triumphant in the courts
- Originally made to save taxpayer money, but became a messy affair
**Extending the Wires**
- All those court battles; also vandalism, cutting of lines
	- By 1851, Morse triumphant! Consolidation of the lines in US
	- Only tree companies still standing
	- by the end of the 1860s only Western Union still standing
	- >150 companies absorbed
	- 37380 miles of cables
	- 2250 telegraph offices 
**International Telegraphy**
- 1842, Morse puts an experimental cable across New York Harbour
- 1849 William O'Shaughnessy Brooke, in British-controlled India, puts an iron rod beneath/across a river, some 4200 feet and transmits a message
- 1852 Frederic Gisborne lays cable between New Brunswick and PEI
- 1854 the New York, Newfoundland and London telegraph company forms; by 1856 has a cable across the Gulf of St Lawrence
- 1858 the atlantic was crossed
- Loading the cable took 3 weeks, about 300 pounds of cable 
- two ships were needed due to the sheer length of the cable 
- wire just stopped working, and they lost 300 miles of cable 
- they tried again in 1858, by going opposite ways 
- it broke 
- they tried a third time in 1859 which worked
- New York went crazy and the city nearly burned down, as always 
- Lord Calvin, the man who already invented the optimal cable came up with the Galvometer, which allows tiny pulses of electricity to observed 
- by 1866, people were ready to try again 
- the ship for this was the great eastern
- these undersea cables destroyed the space of the world 
- communications with other nations and continents could be instantly achieved
- Individual states begin to realize that control of international communications matters.
- Britain especially advantaged: control of gutta pecha, colonies around the world to control start/end of long distant lines 
- 1875 President Grant explains why a French cable company was denied permission to land a cable in US: they gotta let us use their cable in return
**Implications for colonialism**
- takes about 100 days to sail from London to Hong Kong 
- Marx and Engles 1848: 'the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.'
- if distance is collapsed 
- if messages can be transmitted thousands of miles within seconds/minutes
	- then what is to stop a state from expanding its reach?
- Resinous tree-gum that can be crafted in a plastic/rubbery way
- Withoud Gutta-Percha, there is no trans-atlantic cable. There is no long distance telegraphy
- by early 20th century, there are 200000 miles of undersea cable; GP about 27000 tons; that means 88 million trees destroyed
