October 29th, 1969 is not the birth of the internet 
- the internet is a phase transition, the internet does not have a specific birth date
- The United States was not the only nation developing computers and the Internet
Another nation developing the internet was France:
- the French wanted nukes for themselves 
- The United States was not sharing information on nuclear technology, or other forms of internet 
- They set up a fair bit of infastructure to develop a form of the internet 
- they visit places that hold the arpanet and they take notes 

- this was a project led by Louis Pouzin
- Coins the term 'datagram': data+telegram
	- gets the hosts to do the error correction, not the routers
	- makes the hosts responsible for delivery of the data on a 'best-effort' means (le timeouts)
	- the routers ensure transparency end-to-end
	- this greatly simplifies interconnectivity
- this does not end up working

Meanwhile in the Pacific:
- Alohanet
	- University of Hawaii - main campus near Honolulu, other campuses on the main island and on Oahu, Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii - radius of about 300 km
	- 1968 department of Electrical Engineering begin planning a way to broadcast data over radio, rather than wire
	- to permit sharing of the main campus computer
	- technical issues solved and goes into use June 1971
	- come up with the idea that instead of constant broadcasting, different connection points should wait solving a problem

Satnet:
- proposal from Larry Roberts in 1970 to connect ARPANET to Davis' National Physical Labrotory in 1970

PRNET:
- packet radio network
- inspired by alohanet, but hey, let's make things mobile too!
- testbed for techniques
- proposed by 1971, work begins 1973, 10 countries wired up by 1976

Real birth of the internet: November 27 1977
