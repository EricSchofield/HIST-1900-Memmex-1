In previous classes, I always made notes as sort of separate entities. Each note would just be on the class given, and none would connect with either previous notes or future notes. But what this class forced me to do is to connect notes and ideas, leading to a much more expansive database that I could use. One problem I remember having in other classes is having to search each note separately for information, but due to the interlinkage of my notes in this course, information is relatively easy to find as each note will eventually lead to whatever I am looking for. On top of this, it makes me engage more with the material as instead of just copying down notes, I must think about how they connect to both past notes, and possible future notes that I will create. Using the example of my journey, I picked two random notes and looked to see if there was a possible connection between them. Though I created them months apart using different sources, they ended up having a similar premise and being connected. Also, what I found with this journey is that it does not really matter where you start in notes if they are all connected, as each note feeds into other notes, enhancing them. Interlinkage both makes you critically think about a subject, and it makes the notes more enhanced by seeing how different parts of the course link together creating a \u201cbig picture\u201d of the entire course. This is why for me the interlinkage of knowledge is the most powerful thing I learned in this course.</p>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_1/#corporate_influence","title":"corporate_influence","text":"<ul> <li>Through this tag, my atomic note connects to the final node of the journey.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_2/","title":"0 Final Journey 2","text":""},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_2/#the-journey-between-lecture-notesjanuary-11-lecture-notes-and-lecture-notesapril-3-2023-lecture-notes-google","title":"The Journey Between Lecture Notes/January 11 lecture notes and Lecture Notes/April 3 2023 lecture notes - Google","text":"<ul> <li>January 11 lecture notes<ul> <li>This is the first lecture note I took this semester, and as such is the starting point of the journey towards the last lecture not I took this semester</li> </ul> </li> <li> </li> <li>Does the creation of the modern internet follow the same trajectory as the creation of telegraph lines</li> <li> </li> <li>April 3 2023 lecture notes - Google<ul> <li>The final lecture note I wrote this semester, which through tags is connected to the first lecture note I wrote this semester </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>At the start of the course, I wanted to learn about the evolution of the internet over time. I would say that this was met, and I got what I wanted out of the class. I already expected the internet to have a long history that started before computers, but I did not expect it to be so deep. It was interesting learning that due to its nature the internet does not have a clear start date. Does it start with the first written tablets? Or does it start with the actual launching of the internet, even though that also has multiple possible dates. I was not expecting to learn about the \u201cfirst internets\u201d such as the printing press and telegrams, but learning about their history gives a lot more context and information on the formation of the modern internet. This can be shown by the journey through my notes up above. It started with the first lecture note I took in this class, and through an atomic note where I asked myself how similar the telegraph network and the modern internet are, connected to my final lecture note. On top of this, I learned about things I had no idea about, such as the importance of women and other minorities in the creation of the modern internet. As shown with the journey, everything in this course ended up being connected to the point where I can easily find a connection between one of my lecture notes about the internet in the late 1990s and an annotated note on the exploitation of gutta-percha making this course more engaging. In conclusion, I am satisfied with this course and got what I was looking for.</p>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_2/#internet_history","title":"internet_history","text":"<ul> <li>Through the tag of internet history, my first lecture note connects to one of my atomic notes, showing a connection made between my lecture notes and my memex</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_2/#government","title":"government","text":"<ul> <li>through another tag, that of a government being involved, the atomic note connects to my final note</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Lecture%20Notes/April%203%202023%20lecture%20notes%20-%20Google/","title":"April 3 2023 lecture notes   Google","text":"<ul> <li>google was different as it used a structured method for looking for information </li> <li>other sites used keywords, which was easily exploitable </li> <li>the idea that important sites will have other important sites pointing towards them </li> <li>grad project starts in 1996, and by 1999 it has indexed 6 million sites</li> <li>in 2000 google starts selling advertisements </li> <li>leads to immediate legal action because another advertisement had created it first </li> <li>by 2001 Larry Paige has screwed up enough so that Eric Schmitt is brought in as \"parrental supervision\"</li> <li>google was the best browser overall, so it became more and more popular</li> <li>dot com bubble had mostly calmed down </li> <li>googles ip starts in 2004 </li> <li>in 2005 google is listed as 52 billion dollars </li> <li>yahoo by this point splits off their alliance with google and starts circling the drain </li> <li>by the 2010s, google buys up other services, and if something is seen as a risk, they try and kill it off </li> <li>monopoly behaviour </li> <li>google is caught up in many different scandals, such as sexual harassment, predatory surveillance... and it triggers the sherman anti trust laws </li> <li>google is the lens that we use to search the internet </li> <li>google emerges in the post cold war pre 9/11 era, where it embodies the neo-liberal web </li> <li>and once 9/11 happens, google easily transforms into working with the government for surveillance</li> <li>attention scarcity is a very powerful force on the internet, so the spaces that can maximize the usage of that attention scarcity </li> <li>the early language google used was very democratic, and making the implicit connection that \"google was democracy\"</li> <li>this though was not true, and was more of a circle where well used sites just got more and more popular </li> <li>this got burried very quickly  Brin &amp; Page themselves, 1998:     'The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users.
